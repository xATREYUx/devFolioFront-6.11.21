        Using ReactJS and Node I create single-page applications and components
        capable of monetization, data charting, api calls, user
        authentication/authorization, database & context management, and more.

        I've implemented state management systems such as this.state,
        useState(), useContext(), and react-redux, and while creating
        persistence with useMemo() and react-persist.

      <Paragraph className="aboutParagraph">
        I've used react-router-dom for routes and have managed my components'
        lifecycles with both class-based methods and useEffect() hooks.

        Using Ajax and fetch(), via express, I've connected to and queried both
        Mongodb and Firebase database systems while integrating AuthO services.
        Additionally, I've utilized Stripe payment methods, basic optical
        character recognition with tesseract, various charting and css
        libraries, Sassy CSS, styled-components and used chat-bot npm packages.

        This site is an ongoing portfolio project meant to display much, but not
        all, of my understanding of MERN development and my overall knowledge of
        ReactJS. My current goal is most importantly to find employment as a
        software engineer, but ideally also in an organization where I can
        exercise my interests in sales and business concepts.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph className="aboutParagraph">
        Besides both a passion for team work and an ability to work and
        troubleshoot independently, I have a business degree, experience in
        sales, and experience in various fields of enterprise where I have often
        exceeded singular roles.

      <Paragraph className="aboutParagraph">
        Since Covid has all but halted my current business in judicial support,
        I have been allotted the time to escalate my programming skills from
        hobbyist to professional; as I have always wanted to anyway.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph className="aboutParagraph">
        I have studied material from Udemy, YouTube, Stack Overflow,
        documentation and more, with the intention of joining an organization
        where I can exercise my enthusiasm for technology and creating
        innovative solutions.
